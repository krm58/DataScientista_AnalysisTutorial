This is a github repository corresponding to a Raleigh-Durham Data Scientista "Code along with me" session I hosted in March 2022  (https://www.meetup.com/DataScientistaSociety/events/284477242/). The focus of the tutorial was to use data from the American Time Use Survey to answer the question of whether men and women were impacted differently by the COVID-19 pandemic in regards to how they spend their time. Data used in this tutorial was from the American Time Use Survey (as part of the US Census). The jupyter notebook shows how to load the data, how to visualize time use according to multiple different categories, and how to use linear regression to answer this question.
